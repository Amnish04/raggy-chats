‚ùó Are you frustrated by [LLM's Hallucinations](https://medium.com/low-code-for-advanced-data-science/what-are-ai-hallucinations-how-to-mitigate-them-in-llms-4abf0cd54a7a) on queries about things its not trained on?

‚ùó Are you looking for a companion that can **read your documents**, make sense of it, and help?

‚ùó Are you **uncomfortable** with your **personal conversations** with LLM being stored in someone's database?

Here's a hero for the rescue ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Raggy Chats** is a lightweight AI chatbot, focusing specifically on [Retrieval Augemented Generation](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) (RAG), with your documents' embeddings stored locally in [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API).

Users **upload documents** relevant to the context of their queries, and **Raggy Chats** conducts [semantic search](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8868588-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-and-semantic-search-for-gpts) on documents' content, **ranks** the most **relevant** chunks using [Cosine Similarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9U0QAFbfLI), and augments the original query with retrieved context from uploaded documents.

## Getting Started

**Raggy Chats** requires minimal configuration and it's super easy to get started!

1. Open settings by clicking the button on top right.

4. You also have the ability to configure what documents to **include** in context retrieval. Make sure "**Use for RAG**" is turned on for all the documents that you want to use.
